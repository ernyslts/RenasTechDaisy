My framework is based on maven build project so with that
I use pom.xml in order to centralize my dependencies.

I also use configuration properties in order to store my data with key and value.
Also my framework have some utilities in order to make my job easy and to store some ready methods
 and everytime called it and used it, so in this case it is handy call my methods and using utilities.
I also stored my driver utilities classes as well.

I have also parallel execution in my framework so I use surface maven dependency it is helpful
I can run a lot of test cases at the same time.

Definitely I have gherkin language so that even non technical person can understand my framework.
I can get data outside the framework with apache called data driven testing.
 So that help me that cases we know have a lot of data.
